# Tuple
'''Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of
data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities
and usage.

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

Tuples are written with round brackets.

tple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(tple)

Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
