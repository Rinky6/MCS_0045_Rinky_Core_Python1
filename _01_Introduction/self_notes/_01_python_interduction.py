What is Python IDLE?
Python's IDLE is the integrated development environment (IDE) and learning platform for Python.

IDLE Advantages

1 Firstly, I would say Python IDLE interface is user friendly.
2 Easy to learn for the beginners.
3 Syntax highlighting is nice features.
4 Smart indent helps a lot.
5 Integrated debugger with stepping, persistent breakpoints, and call stack visibility.

IDLE Disadvantages

1 A file created using Python IDLE cannot be accessed from a device other than the one in which
it is created unless being copied
into or sent to another device.
2 Changes are not saved automatically as we code.
3 It is not as advanced as its contemporaries.
4 Multi-window text editor with syntax highlighting, autocompletion, smart indent and other.

what is Pycharm
PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically
for the Python language.
It is developed by the Czech company JetBrains (formerly known as IntelliJ).
[5] It provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, integration with
version control systems (VCSes),
and supports web development with Django as well as data science with Anaconda.[6]PyCharm is cross-platform


Pycham Advantages

1 Intelligent Coding Assistance.
PyCharm provides smart code completion, code inspections, on-the-fly error highlighting and quick-fixes,
along with automated code refactorings and rich navigation capabilities. ...
2 Built-in Developer Tools. ...
3 Web Development. ...
4 Scientific Tools. ...
5 Customizable and Cross-platform IDE.

Pycharm Disadvantages

1 The main disadvantage of using PyCharm is, it takes more space than other text editors which degrade
 the functionality of code.
2 The community version is idle for python development only and does not allow to use other programming languages.
3 The professional version is somewhat expensive.

what is Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets,
 code refactoring, and embedded Git.

Visual Studio Code Advantages

1 1. Cross-platform support :
      Windows
       Linux
        Mac
2. Light-weight
3. Robust Architecture
4. Intelli-Sense
5. Freeware: Free of Cost- probably the best feature of all for all the programmers out there,
even more for the organizations.
6. Many users will use it or might have used it for desktop applications only,
but it also provides great tool support for Web Technologies like; HTML, CSS, JSON.

Disadvantages
 1 Cut UI functionality in comparison of Visual Studio. Debug is not fully available as you can expect
 2 Not easy to install all necessary plugins to make the system stable
 3  Some annoying moments that always need to install the plugin after the next plugin...
 Sometimes plugin installation can force VS Code to crash.

What is Anaconda IDE

Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing
(data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.),
that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

Advantages of Anaconda ide

1 It is free and open-source.
2 It has more than 1500 Python/R data science packages.
3 Anaconda simplifies package management and deployment.
4 It has tools to easily collect data from sources using machine learning and AI.

DisAdvantages
1 It's hard to get security updates when you leave the system packages.
2 There're some PyPI packages that Anaconda doesn't have. This obligates the user to package it by
herself or using pip.
3 Anaconda isn't as fast as PyPI publications.
