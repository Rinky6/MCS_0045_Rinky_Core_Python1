Conversion in mathematics :
---------------------------
Conversion : Measurement: to change from one unit to another
                          such as from inches to millimeters, or liters to gallons

Temperature:
°C	  °F	Description
37	98.6	Body temperature

Length:
            1 km = 1000 m
            1 m  = 100 cm
            1 cm = 10 mm    ==> 1KM + 100M ==>  1KM + 0.1KM = 1.1 KM**
                                               1000M + 100M = 1100 M

Mass:
            1 tonne = 1000 kg
            1 kg    = 1000 gm
            1 gm    = 1000 mg
            1 mg    = 0.0154 grain

Volume/Capacity:
