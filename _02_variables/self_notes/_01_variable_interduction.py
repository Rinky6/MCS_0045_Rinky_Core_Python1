 # Python Variables:
""". A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it. A
variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a
program.
"""

""" 
1 The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
2. A  variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the
variable effects that memory location.
"""
# Rules for creating variables in Python:
"""1.A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
2.A variable name cannot start with a number.
3.A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z,
0-9, and _ ).
4.Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different
variables).
5 The reserved words(keywords) cannot be used naming the variable."""
